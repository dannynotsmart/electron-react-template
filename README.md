# electron-react-template

A template generated from modifying the boilerplate code provided by [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate). Huge props to all the contributors of that repository!

## Why does this exist?

I was too lazy to reconfigure everything from the boilerplate so I made this template so that I could quickly clone and begin working on a new project. This repo is meant for personal usage only so if you want more information visit the [original boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate).

## Install

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 --branch main https://github.com/dannynotsmart/electron-react-template.git your-project-name
cd your-project-name
npm install
```

## Starting Development

Start the app in the `dev` environment:

```bash
npm start
```

## Packaging for Production

To package apps for the local platform:

```bash
npm run package
```
